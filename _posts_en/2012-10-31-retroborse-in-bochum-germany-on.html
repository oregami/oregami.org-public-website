The next event of the "Retrobörse" ist coming up: on November, 10th there will be something like a really big flea market in Bochum, Germany - by nerds and for nerds - filled with retro stuff like old computers, consoles, games and merchandising.<br />
<br />There will be one single booth selling old <b>gaming magazines</b> exclusively - which is mine.<!--more-->

As <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.402396526460975.96362.167444249956205&amp;type=3" target="_blank">usual</a> I will offer hundreds of issues from mags like Powerplay, ASM, Video Games, Maniac, PcXtreme, 64er and more.<br /><br />Of course - that's the reason for writing here - you may interrogate me about our online game database <b>Oregami</b>: What do you think about our project? What ideas or wishes do you have? How could yo help us build the best online game database "ever"?<br />Things concerning my "other" website <a href="http://www.kultpower.de/" target="_blank">Kultpower.de</a> are permitted as well :-)<br /><br />Come and enter a great retro world!
